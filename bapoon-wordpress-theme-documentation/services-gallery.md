The services page can be managed using Elementor page builder.

There is a separate post type for Services, as shown below.

You can edit these using Elementor to edit the content of the Service pages.

One more important thing is that the Gallery items shown on Gallery page are also associated with Services. To manage those images, please edit the Services in wp-admin traditionally as shown below.

and then change featured images here.

If you want normal Gallery instead, You can opt to use Gallery module available in Elementor Page builder.
