# Pages

All pages are created with Elementor Page builder. So editing is as easy as point and click.

You can edit page from wp-admin/pages or you can also Edit any page directly from Front end by clicking Edit with Elementor menu on the Top.

Once you click the Edit button, the Elementor edit panel will load and you can point and click any element on page to see edit options on the left side. You can also edit some text by just clicking and start typing.

If you need help, there is very large community for Elementor so Google your Youtube can help alot. After less than 1 hour of learning curve you will start enjoying the Elementor a lot!

Elementor provides so much flexibility, here is an example GIF, a customer wanted to use his own image of different size in one of the block, here is how to achieve the same.
